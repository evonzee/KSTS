Release Payload button can be replaced with monitoring selected decoupler
Workflows need to be cleaned up

As an example of the UI issues:


2. This is the confusing part.  

Click the toolbar button to show

Click the Deploy button, it shows the different payloads

Two different missions show, Deployment Mission and Probecore_To_Deploy.  The masses shown on this window appear to be launch weight of the vehicle

Click either of them, and the two missions will be replaced by what appears to be the missions which can deploy the selected payload.  This window is actually showing all missions;  I ran a mission to put a 4520 kg payload in orbit, yet after selecting the payload, both missions (yours and mine) show up.  This may be a result of you're cheating the vessel to orbit.

Then, I tried sending your payload up with my rocket, and then the ETA started counting down.  But there is no explanation of why the ETA was 4 hours.  It may be to launch at the same time of day, but I don't know why.  This mod has good promise, but these issues should be addressed

Workflows

Record a launch
	Click Record in top row (maybe pause game while dialog gets filled out, FlightDriver.SetPause = true)
	Select whether a Deploy or Transport
	If Deploy
		Select deploy decoupler
	if Transport
		Specify amount of resources which are designated as transport
	Click Record (change to Start Recording)
	Click Abort

fairing with interstage are not shown as decouplers

You can start recording before selecting a decoupler (for the deliver)
