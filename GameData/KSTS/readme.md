# KSTS: Kerbal Space Transport System

## Introduction

This Kerbal Space Program Mod allows the player to automate routine missions to Kerbin-orbit, like crew and resource transfers as well as deployment of new ships, by recording and replaying missions.

Includes a small patch by base10 to allow launches from other bodies than Kerbin, generally facilitated by Kerbal Konstructs or similar.
